			<h1>Really? MacGyver's First Name Is Angus?</h1>
			<p>Yep, that's right! Angus MacGyver, born March 23, 1951, is the most awesome fictional character in the history of fictional characters. Whether it's using bubble gum, a paper clip, or even last night's left overs, he'll have that bomb defused and escape boat ready to go in a blink of an eye. Everyone has heard of his amazing resourcefulness and non-violent problem solving skills. Heck, he made an airplane out of just some duct tape, a tarp, and a cement mixer!</p>
